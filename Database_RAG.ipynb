We'll focus on supply chain management (SCM) in the context of geopolitical fragmentation.\n","\n","## What is Database RAG?\n","\n","Traditional RAG systems work with unstructured text documents:\n","1. Documents are split into chunks\n","2. Chunks are embedded into vectors\n","3. User questions are matched to relevant chunks using vector similarity\n","4. Retrieved chunks are sent to an LLM along with the question to generate an answer\n","\n","Database RAG works differently:\n","1. User questions are translated into SQL queries\n","2. SQL queries are executed against a database\n","3. Query results are formatted as context\n","4. Context is sent to an LLM along with the question to generate an answer\n","\n","This approach has several advantages:\n","- More precise retrieval through structured queries\n","- Better handling of numerical data and aggregations\n","- Ability to answer questions that require calculations\n","- More efficient for large datasets\n","\n","## Supply Chain Management and Geopolitical Fragmentation\n","\n","In today's world, supply chains are increasingly affected by geopolitical fragmentation:\n","- Tariff barriers pushing toward local supply chains\n","- Pandemic disruptions affecting global logistics\n","- Regional conflicts creating supply uncertainties\n","- Trade policies favoring domestic production\n","\n","Our RAG system will help answer critical questions for supply chain managers:\n","- Which products are sourced locally vs globally?\n","- Which suppliers have the highest geopolitical risk?\n","- What alternative suppliers exist in different regions?\n","- How do tariff rates affect our procurement strategy?\n","\n","## What We'll Build\n","\n","In this notebook, we'll build a complete database RAG system that:\n","1. Creates a sample SQLite database with regions, suppliers, products, and sales data\n","2. Translates natural language questions into SQL queries using both rule-based and LLM approaches\n","3. Executes these queries and formats the results\n","4. Generates answers using various methods (simple extractive or LLM-based)\n","5. Provides an interactive UI for testing\n","\n","## Setup\n","\n","First, let's install the necessary dependencies:"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":27,"id":"6caec6ef","metadata":{"id":"6caec6ef","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1753955513058,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":7163,"user":{"displayName":"Kevin Power","userId":"08364910535594493232"}},"outputId":"b6b0cad3-9576-45d9-f357-c1d15192902c","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"}},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["\u001b[31mERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement sqlite3 (from versions: none)\u001b[0m\u001b[31m\n","\u001b[0m\u001b[31mERROR: No matching distribution found for sqlite3\u001b[0m\u001b[31m\n","\u001b[0m"]}],"source":["# Install required packages\n","!pip install sqlite3 pandas numpy requests ipywidgets"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":28,"id":"baf57ea8","metadata":{"lines_to_next_cell":1,"id":"baf57ea8","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1753955513103,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":49,"user":{"displayName":"Kevin Power","userId":"08364910535594493232"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["# Import necessary libraries\n","import os\n","import re\n","import sqlite3\n","import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","import requests\n","import json\n","from datetime import datetime, timedelta\n","import random\n","\n","# Check if we're running in a Jupyter notebook\n","try:\n","    from IPython.display import display, HTML, clear_output\n","    import ipywidgets as widgets\n","    in_notebook = True\n","except ImportError:\n","    in_notebook = False\n","    print(\"Not running in a Jupyter notebook.

Provides an **interactive UI** for testing\n","\n","This approach demonstrates how to combine the power of LLMs with structured data querying, providing accurate answers based on your database content.\n","\n","## Possible Extensions\n","\n","Here are some ways you could extend this system:\n","\n","1. **Add more rule patterns** to handle additional question types\n","2. **Implement SQL validation** to ensure generated queries are safe and correct\n","3. **Add caching** to avoid regenerating the same SQL queries\n","4. **Create visualizations** based on query results\n","5. **Integrate with local LLMs** like Ollama for fully offline operation\n","6. **Add query history** to track and reuse previous questions and answers\n","7. **Implement feedback mechanisms** to improve
