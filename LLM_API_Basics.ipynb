Its faculty and alumni have been associated with numerous groundbreaking inventions and innovations, including radar, the digital computer, synthetic self-replicating molecules, and the development of the internet’s early architecture. As of 2024, MIT affiliates have won 100+ Nobel Prizes, 50+ National Medals of Science, and numerous other honors. The Institute places strong emphasis on entrepreneurship; companies founded by MIT alumni generate trillions of dollars in annual revenue and employ millions of people worldwide.\n","Research at MIT is supported by more than 30 departments and over 80 interdisciplinary labs and centers. Notable among them are the MIT Media Lab, the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL), the Lincoln Laboratory (a federally funded R&D center), and the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research. MIT consistently ranks among the top universities in global research output and innovation metrics.\n","MIT's campus spans 168 acres along the Charles River and features a mix of historic and modern architecture, including buildings designed by noted architects such as Alvar Aalto, Frank Gehry, and I.M. Pei. Student life at MIT is known for being intense but collaborative, with a wide array of extracurricular opportunities, including athletics, music, entrepreneurship clubs, and the Independent Activities Period (IAP), a January term where students can pursue short courses, projects, or travel.\n","Admissions to MIT are highly competitive. For undergraduate admission, MIT does not consider legacy status or demonstrated interest and has a need-blind admissions policy for all applicants, including international students. Financial aid is entirely need-based, and MIT guarantees to meet the full demonstrated financial need of admitted students. In 2023, over 70% of undergraduates received financial aid, and the median annual debt at graduation was zero.\n","MIT’s motto, “Mens et Manus” — Latin for “Mind and Hand” — reflects its educational philosophy of integrating theoretical knowledge with practical application.
